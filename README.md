# SongSharingApp


This app basically helps you to make new friends, share songs and comment on each other's song sense. 

**Find the Demo Video to my App @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO0Oo21XaOU**

### Why did I choose this idea?

Theres is not a person ear-plugged in long journeys, though I have seen a rare bunch of guys hitting the pad hard with first shooter games and Clash Royale of course :). If that’s how we are — fond of listening melody than gearing up for a clan clash — then this is a day saver.

### What’s so good about a Song?

It makes you calm and clear as water. Peace and carefree oblivion.

## Making it Intriguing-

How will it sound if I just get all your friends together on a forum where you get to know the personal fancy each holds to a set of songs? Awesome, right? You could make a song circle, pin up comments on your friends and customize your own featured collection of songs.
